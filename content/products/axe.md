### Description

This is your connector if you have: (this list is not comprehensive)

- Yaesu FT-65, FT-25, FT-4VR, FT-4XR

- Baofeng UV-5R/5X3 (and other variants), GT-3, UV-82, UV-B5, and most others
- Kenwood TK-2107/3107/2260/3260/3160/278/378, some others
- Anytone TERMN-8R, OBLTR-8R, NSTIG-8R, ANILE-8R, and most others others
- Wouxun UV6D, UV2D, UVD1P (most newer models use SMA-M, but any model could have either, so check!
- Alinco DJ-MD5
- others…

See Ham Radio School’s What’s that connector on my HT? If the center conductor on the SMA connector on your radio is a pin, this is for you.

#### Feautures

- Frequency range:
  - Dual band version – 1/4 wave on 2 meter (144-148Mhz) and 3/4 wave on 70 centimeter (420-450Mhz)
    - SWR has been measured as low as:
      - 1.3:1 @ 146Mhz
      - 1.5:1 @ 440Mhz
      - [This SWR chart](https://signalstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/g.png) was taken using a balun to isolate the antenna and a ~18″ tiger tail to stabilize the SWR. Take it with a grain of salt, but it’s fairly accurate as far as it goes.
      - While it’s intended for Amateur Radio use it has been found to work acceptably on MURS or GMRS frequencies as well!
  - Single band 220 version – 1/4 wave on 1.25 meter (222-225Mhz)
  - Single band 440 version – 1/4 wave on 70 centimeter (centered at approximately 440Mhz but adequate even on GMRS)
- Power limits:
  - Dual band version: 100 Watts max at 50% duty cycle or 50 Watts max at 100% duty cycle
    - [For more information on how this was determined see this whitepaper draft](https://signalstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Estimate_2m-70cm_Capacity.pdf)
- Length
  - Dual band version – Approximately 19″ long
  - Single band 220 version – Approximately 12″ long
  - Single band 440 version – Approximately 6″ long
- Custom designed 3d printed tip and connector cover providing unprecedented strength
- Made of [Nitinol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_titanium), a very resilient and ridiculously flexible nickel-titanium alloy
- Extremely light-weight — reduces connector strain on your radio!
- Hand-made by hams in Utah
- [Lifetime guarantee!](http://signalstuff.com/antennas/rma/)
- [Nearly indestructible](https://signalstuff.com/antennas/video-review/)
