See Ham Radio School’s What’s that connector on my HT? If the center conductor on the SMA connector on your radio is a pin, this is for you.

#### Feautures

•	Dual band – 1/4 wave on 2m (144-148Mhz) and 3/4 wave on 70cm (440-448Mhz)
	⁃	SWR has been measured as low as:
	⁃	1.3:1 @ 146Mhz
	⁃	1.5:1 @ 440Mhz
	⁃	This SWR chart was taken using a balun to isolate the antenna and a ~18″ tiger tail to stabilize the SWR. Take it with a grain of salt, but it’s fairly accurate as far as it goes.
	•	Custom designed 3d printed tip and connector cover providing unprecedented strength
	•	Approximately 18.25″ long
	•	Made of Nitinol, a very resilient and ridiculously flexible nickel-titanium alloy
	•	Extremely light-weight — reduces connector strain on your radio!
	•	Hand-made by hams in Utah
	•	Lifetime guarantee!
	•	Nearly indestructible
